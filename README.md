# RPG Practice

These are two projects I made to practice real time based combat. It was also a good practice for an interactive menu.\
It was never intended to be finished, just for practice.

You control a Paladin and a Wizard with the goal to defeat the hord of enemies coming at you.

The combat is iteractive.\
Both the enemies and the player can attack.\
Both take damage and can die.\
Both have speed variables which determines who is going to attack first.\
To perform actions you have to collect ability points that appears time to time on the screen in a form of a "bubble". You have to click it to collect.

The players can use or Physical Attacks or Spells.\
The players can also defend from the attacks if clicked on time.\
Physical Attacks do damage.\
Spells could be used for attack, buffs, effects or debuffs.

Spells have types of damage, Ice, Fire or Water.\
Depending on the enemy resistance, they can do more or less damage. Or even none.\
You also have effects you can do on the enemy, like Freezing (paralyzes the enemy), Burn (enemy takes damage over time), Silence (they can't cast spells) and Blind (they may miss some attacks).

Spells can also give you protection such as Agility (you become faster), Strength (you become stronger) , Armor Protection (you gain more Armor Protection), Magic Protection (you gain magic protection), Magic Up (your spells become stronger) and High Vitality (more health).\
Some spells are permenent through the entire fight, others have a timer.

Spells can debuff as well, such as Clumsy (you make the enemy slower), Weaken (you make the enemy weaker), Deflate Armor (enemies have less armor), Deflate Magic (enemies have less magic resistance), Feeblemind (enemies spells are weaker) and Dispel (removes buffs from the enemy).

Spells can also heal.

All spells have a level of casting, for example, Dispel 1 (Removes One Random Stats from the Target), Dispel 3 (Removes Three Random Stats from the target) and so on.

You can switch players if both players are ready to attack.\
You can defend from an attack when the enemy is near attacking.
